## how to build
Install the dependencies (make, gcc, lua; liblua will be a future dependency)

Run `make -j`

## repo structure

src/ - C source code files
include/ - C headers
docs/ - No docs (yet), just some planning stuff on the structure of the system atm. Nothing more than mental notes for myself really
